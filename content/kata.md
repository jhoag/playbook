## Kata: Check Your Work
A university has greatly expanded its CS course and wants to be able to automate the grading of simple programming assignments.

Users: 300+ students per year, plus staff and admin.
### Requirements:
* students must be able to upload their source code, which will be run and graded
* grades and runs must be persistent and audit-able
* required plagiarism detection system involving comparing with other submissions and also submitting to a web-based service (TurnItIn).
* integration required with the University's learning management system (LMS)
* professor sets due date and time, after which submissions are rejected
* students can submit as many attempts as they want to improve their grade
* professors determine grading criteria, which may include metrics and/or tests

### Additional Context:
* University's LMS is mainframe based and quite difficult to make changes to
* grades are audited each year by state-based regulatory body
* University has very little budget for IT as it is building a spare stadium for SportsBall
* University has a record for highest-performing CS graduates in the country
