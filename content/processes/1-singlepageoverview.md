> **_10,000 Ft Overview_:** Create a 10,000 ft overview of what the feature provides and where it fits into the landscape. _This does not have to be "correct"_.  If the feature is a replacement or modification of an existing feature, include the "as is" and the "to be".  Regardless of notation, consider the C4 model - and remain at C1.
